	This work attempts to distinguish what the ultimate future holds in store,and debates what would be a better fate: a future with only technology, or a future with only nature? Despite the fact that in this image I am wearing headphones and holding a longboard, this work represents a point of view against a future containing only of technology.
	As I see it, technology is great. The courses I am taking, and the degree I am aiming for would not be possible without technology. Although, I believe if the world were to only consist of technology it would be dark. Everything would be simulated, and that is something that could not be taken away - since the beauty of nature is the fact that itâ€™s irreplaceable and crafted through pure chance (or through the eyes of God). Technology does a good job at destroying something it could never equate to itself.
	All that said, the image portrays all these elements through a cartoonish representation. The mushroom clouds support the idea that technology destroys nature: specifically, in the background (not very visible) are clouds of the Nagasaki bomb. This feat off technology was capable of completely whipping out an entire city - and rendering the nature within it completely useless. The coloured rays in the background represent the underlying beauty of nature. The original image was split apart with masking and shading to give the resulting image more depth and different levels of space.
	It is easy to cover nature with technology, so always remember to take time to enjoy nature in and of itself. If I were destined to chose one or the other - nature would always win, but ideally we are living in the future now - and that is having a balance of both.
